# <h1 align="center"> 👋Welcome to the Minimally Designed analog-clock🎵 👋 </h1>
Wanna go back to good old analog era or you might be tired of changing your clock's batteries😁 
whatever the case is let's try this clock! (proud of my marketing skill 😎)

Made with nice, cute, powerful, pure **vanilla JavaScript!**😍


I kept this design simple and intuitive bearing something important in mind- __Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication__
I will share my design insights breifly in a moment so that beginner could understand what design actually means.
